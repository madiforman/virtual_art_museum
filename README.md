# Museum of Virtual Art (MoVA)
![Build/Test Workflow]
(https://github.com/madiforman/virtual_art_museum/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)

## Project Type: Tool

## Group Members:
- Madison Sanchez-Forman
- Mya Strayer
- Zhansaya Ussembayeva

## Questions of Interest: Can we display archival artwork in a way that allows users to filter through it like they were at a musuem. I.E. by exhibit, artist, artistic movement or time period. A goal is to display historic information about the art as well.

Use Cases: Being able to view and explore art pieces using various filters, downloading a view of a user's favorite artworks. Most of the website will be scrollable, with the option to click on an artpiece to learn more about the specific work. Filters for time period, art style, and region will be available on the sidebar and can be reset. After a user has selected nine (or ten?) of their favorite pieces, they will be able to select the 'Favorites' page and view a printable version of their favorite artwork.

Goal of Project Output: Streamlit Web App
